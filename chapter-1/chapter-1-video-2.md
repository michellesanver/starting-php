# Chapter 1, Video 2: Programming

M: In todays world, software is everywhere. If you look around you, you see your TV that has software in it. Train systems have software to make them not collide. The machines at the hospital all have software in them to make them work precisly and for you to survive. Without software our modern world would not exist.

C: Your smartphone is a little computer with lots of software running on it all the time. But there are many more places where software is running. For example in a microwave, controlling how much power the food is subjected to, so your food turns out hot, not burnt. But also Traffic lights are controlled by software, making sure cars don't drive at the same time, and that traffic flows well trhough larger cities. Or if you buy something off a vending machine, that is controlled by software as well.

M: You can program a website like we do in this course. But you can also control your home with home automation. Or build a simple robot such as this cute little one (show robot)
