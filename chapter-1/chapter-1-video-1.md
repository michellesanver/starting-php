# Chapter 1, Video 1: Expectation Management

M: Hi, I'm Michelle

C: And I'm Christian

M: I have been doing PHP since year 2000 when I was 12 years old, so that means I've been growing up with PHP.

C: I've been using PHP about as long as Michelle, in various projects from very small to gigantic.

M: Speaking of gigantic projects, thats what we both are working with at Liip. We are in the same team, team Lego, because we love lego. Liip is a webagency in Switzerland, where we are using PHP on a daily basis.

C: We started this course because we wanted to help our apprentices learn PHP. While looking for ressources suited for absolute beginners, we thought we could contribute a different perspective of learning PHP. Since we live and breathe open source at Liip, we want to share this with everyone. Our goal is to teach you everything you need to know so that you can start a PHP project of your own.

M: During this course you will build a website, namely the php tutorial website that is linked in the video description. In fact you might be on it right now if you are not directly watching this on youtube.

C: You don't need any programming experience before using this course. It's suitable for absolutely everyone. If you already have some experience, just skip ahead when we cover something you know. All you need is a computer and an internet connection and you are good to go.

M: In this course you will *obviously* learn PHP as a programming language. To learn PHP we will also teach you how the internet works and how websites are built. We will briefly cover data storage and some of the tools that you need. We will also share common practices that will help you along the way.
