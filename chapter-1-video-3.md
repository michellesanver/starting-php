enter url in browser
browser doesnt know which server

Network, distributed, no central point
dns server translates name into IP and returns it to browser

webserver takes a specific request that browser sent
if it sees that th requested page has PHP in it, it will call PHP server to execute the code

Webserver sends completed response back to browser
Browser displays HTML, CSS and other content such as images and videos
