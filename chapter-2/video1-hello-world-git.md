# Git ready

When we started programming we often had situations where we wanted to rewrite what we have, but save the old version. To do this we would copy the file, and rename the old file into file_old.php. This got out of hand quickly, and keeping history this way was very difficult to see which one was made when. Version control is there for us to solve this problem. 

With version control it keeps track of all the versions that you have saved. One version is like a snapshot of all your code at that moment in time. You can go between different snapshots as much as you like, and they are always there. You can also compare different snapshots and leave comments with each snapshot to see what changed when, and why. 

Since all our versions are there, we never have to worry about work getting lost when we try out new ideas. 

Git is being used as a basic tool by professional programmers everywhere, not only in PHP. If doesn't matter if you have a huge project or a tiny one. If there's lots of people working, or only you: You benefit from it either way. 

Additional benefits you get from git is that you can provide context to your code. You will see the version messages when you look at old code, and then remember more what it was about.
