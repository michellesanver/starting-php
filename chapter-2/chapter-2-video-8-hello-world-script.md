# Chapter 2 video 8: Hello world script
Open your code editor, atom. Go to the "File" menu and select open. Browse to the directory that you clones in a previous chapter. Click "open". You will now see your directory and your readme file in the sidebar to your left. Now we can create our new file. Go to the "file" meny again, select "new file" and you will see a new tab "untitled". Go to "File" again and choose "save". Ensure you are still in the phptutorial folder and enter "index.php", press save. Now you will see that file above the readme file. 

Ensure that you save often! Remember the shortcut you see in the file menu. You can see that it's {shortcut} on {operating system}. 

Congratulations! Now, finally, we get to write some PHP! All PHP code starts with the PHP tag. <?php. We need the tag so that PHP knows where the code starts, and what it should run. You will see in a later chapter how you can mix PHP with HTML. 

write echo 'hello world'; Echo is a language construct that outputs text. The text needs to be in single or double quotes so PHP knows where it starts and ends. There are some differences between single and double quotes, we will show you some of them in a future chapter. 

A PHP instruction always ends with semicolon, that way PHP knows when it's done with that instruction. If you forget it, PHP will output a "syntax error" telling you which line you probably forgot. You can see the line numbers on your left. Our echo instruction is on line 3. 

The script runs from top to bottom and left to right. A lot like reading in english. Let's go run our code in the next video!
