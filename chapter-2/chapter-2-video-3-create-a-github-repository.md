# Chapter 2 video 3: Create your github repository
A repository can be seen as an online folder on github, which not only stores the files, but also the history of it. This is where git comes in, like we explained in a previous video, git is used to keep versions of your files. Files can be anything, such as PHP code, images, videos, spreadsheets or text files. 

So let's create the repository you will be using during this tutorial!

VIDEO: To create a new repository you click the + icon next to your username up here. Choose "New repository". The only things you need to fill in is the repository name, and let's create a readme file by default. A README.md file is the first file that a programmer reads when they go to your project. And the first one you can read if you go to someone elses project. It describes what the project is about, and how to install or use it. It is also for you to remember things about the project when you code. For instance you could have information on how to get the project running. You will thank your past self if you do this properly! This is why we choose to tick the box.

The rest can be left to default. Click create. You will now get to this screen, advicing you what you can do next. Congratulations, you have created your first repository!
