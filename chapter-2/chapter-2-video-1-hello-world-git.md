# Chapter 2, video 1: Git ready!

When we started programming years ago we often had situations where we wanted to rewrite what we have, but save the old version. To do this we would copy the file, and rename the old file into file_old.php. This got out of hand quickly, and keeping history this way was very difficult to see which one was made when. Version control is there for us to solve this problem. 

With version control it keeps track of all the versions that you have saved, so that you don't have to do that manually. You only see one version at a time. A version is like a snapshot of all your code at that moment in time. You can go between different snapshots as much as you like, and they are always there. You can also compare different snapshots and leave comments with each snapshot to see what changed when, and most importantly; why. When you leave a comment on a version think "Will I remember why in 6 months with this comment?". That comment is called a "commit message" in git. The snapshot is called a "commit".

Since all our versions are there, we never have to worry about work getting lost when we try out new ideas. We can also put our code on other computers with git. Git can be your code backup system, so that if your computer breaks, you always have your code. 

Version control systems is a basic tool used by professional programmers everywhere, not only in PHP. It doesn't matter if you have a huge project or a tiny one. If there's lots of people working, or only you: You benefit from it either way.
