# Git cloning
Now that you have git, you can clone the repository you created in the previous video to start working with it. You do this by going to your repository on github and then click the “clone or download” button, press the button to copy the URL. Then open your terminal. Write “git clone” and copy in the url (purposely write git glone instead). You can name the directory here by writing “git clone” followed by the name you want of the directory. By default if you leave this empty, it will have the name of the repository.

Oops: If you mistype a command git will try to give you suggestions what the right one is, and you can try again with no harm done. (write it correctly). Write ls to see all the directories. Now you want to change directory in the console to the one you just cloned. You do this by writing “cd” followed by the directory name. So cd phptutorial. Write ls to see your files again. If you see the readme file you created, all is good.
