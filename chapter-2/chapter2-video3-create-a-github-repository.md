# Create your github repository
A repository can be seen as an online folder on github, which not only stores the files, but also the history of it. This is where git comes in, like we explained in a previous video, git is used to keep versions of your files. Files can be anything, such as PHP code, images, videos, spreadsheets or text files. 

So let's create the repository you will be using during this tutorial!

VIDEO: To create a new repository you click the + icon next to your username up here. Choose "New repository". The only things you need to fill in is the repository name, and let's create a readme file by default. A README.md file is the first file that a programmer reads when they go to your project. And the first one you can read if you go to someone elses project. It contains important information about the project and how to install it, or what it is about. 

The rest can be left to default. Click create. You will now get to this screen, advicing you what you can do next. Congratulations! You have the basic setup done.
