# Your first PR
A big part of git and github is collaboration. Let's see just how easy it is by creating your first pull request! A pull request is you suggesting changes to one or several files. 

VIDEO: 
First you go to github.com/WHATEVERITWILLBE/phptutorial which is the php tutorial repository. In there you will see I_WAS_HERE.md, click that file.

Then press the edit icon in the top right corner, and add your name to the file. Scroll down and add a commit message. A commit message is the description of the change that created a new version of the file. Every time you make a commit, it will be a new version of the file.

Press the commit button to save your changes. Behind the scenes github now automatically creates a new copy of the phptutorial repository to your account with the change in it. Now you can suggest to merge your change into the main phptutorial repository. This suggestion is called a "pull request.". That way someone can look at the suggestions, and suggest changes, before they go into the final version. 

Press the "Create pull request" button. If you have anything to tell us, feel free to add it here! Note that this information is public and anyone can see your message. 

Create pull request. It can take up to a few days for us to accept your changes! When we have you will get a notification about it via github, and your name or nickname will show up in the list! Congratulations, you have made your first open source pull request.
