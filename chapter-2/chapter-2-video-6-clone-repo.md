# Chapter 2 video 6: Git cloning
Now that you have git, you can clone the repository you created in the previous video to start working with it. You do this by going to your repository on github and then click the “clone or download” button, press the button to copy the URL. Then open your terminal. Write “git clone” and paste the url (purposely write git glone instead) and press enter. Thank you git! Yes we mean git clone. When we make a typo in a git command, we often get useful hints on what we did wrong.

When you git clone the code will end up in a directory on your computer. By default it will be a new directory with the name of the repository. But you can also name the directory anything you want by writing “git CLONE url” followed by the name.

Now you want to change directory in the console to the one you just cloned. You do this by writing “cd” followed by the directory name. So cd phptutorial. Write ls to see your files again. If you see the readme file you created, all is good.
