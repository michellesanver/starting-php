# Chapter 2 video 2: Create github account
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration, there are many of these platforms. Such as gitlab and bitbucket. GitHub lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. In fact, it allows you to connect with us! You, and all the people following this tutorial will be using github. It is a common tool in the open source world, and very popular in the PHP community. 

While github is free to use, if you put code on github it's publicly viewable in the free use model. You can have private code on there, but that will cost money. Having your code public is usually a good idea, unless you are working on secret projects. Letting other people see your code, means that they can come with suggestions or find errors. Publicly available code is often more secure than private code. You can add licenses to your public code, so that others can use it only in the way you specify. You can learn more about licenses in the linked resource. We will do everything publicly, and there's no secrets here....

You can also see github a bit like a backup, because it is both on your computer and online. But the big point for us here is that: With github we can collaborate. So let's get started right now! If you already have a github account you can skip the rest of this video.
